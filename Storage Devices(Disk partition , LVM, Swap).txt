Practical 4:- Storage Devices(Disk partition , LVM, Swap)
Steps:-
● Power off the machine.
● 1
st go to the Virtual Machine settings ->Add-> Add Hardware wizard ->Hard disk->
Next->SCSI-> Next -> Select a disk -> Give the disk size -> Select the option split
Virtual disk into multiple file -> Next -> Finish -> Ok.


● #fdisk -l : used to display information about all the available disk partitions on the system,
including their sizes, types, and file system details.
● #fdisk /dev/sdb : used to run the fdisk utility on the "sdb" disk device, allowing the user to
create, delete, and manage partitions on that specific disk.
● Enter n command for add a new partition. -> p for select default. -> Enter 1 for partition
number -> Enter -> Enter last sector of size .
● Similarly all partitions are done.
● Enter command p for print the partition table.

● W:- write table to disk and exit.
● #partprobe /dev/sdb : used to inform the operating system of any changes made to the partition
table on the "sdb" disk device, without requiring a system reboot, so that the updated partition
information becomes immediately available.
● #mkfs.xfs /dev/sdb1 : used to create a new XFS file system on the "sdb1" partition, formatting it
and making it ready for data storage and retrieval.
●
● #mkdir partiton1 : used to create a new directory named "partition1" in the current working
directory, providing a location to store files and directories within that specific partition or disk
space.
● #mount /dev/sdb1 partition1 : used to mount the file system located on the "sdb1" partition to
the "partition1" directory, making the files and directories in that partition accessible at the
specified mount point.
● # df -lh :- displays mounted file systems.
● Enter t for change a partition’s system id. -> Enter partition numbers -> Type L for all list. -> 82
● #mkswap /dev/sdb3:- Format it with swap file system.
● # free -h :- To check current memory usage.
● #swapon -s :- To check currently active swap partitons
● # swapon /dev/sdb3:- To activate swap.
● # swapoff /dev/sdb3:- To deactivate swap.


● Enter 8e for changing the type of partition ‘Linux’ to ‘Linux’.
● #pvcreate /dev/sdc{2,3}:- To create physical volume.
● #vgcreate /dev/vg1 /dev/sdc{1,2}:- To create volume group.
● #pvdisplay :- To display physical volume.
● # vgdisplay:- To display volume group.
● #lvcreate -L +1G -n /dev/vg/v1 :- To create logical volume.
● # lvextend -L +1G /dev/vg/v1:- To extend logical volume.
● #lvreduce -L -600M /dev/vg/v1 :- To reduce logical volume.
● # lvdisplay :- To display logical volume.
● # vgextend /dev/vg1 /dev/sdc3:- To extend volume group.
● # vgreduce /dev/vg /dev/sdc3 :- To reduce volume group.
● #lvmremove /dev/vg/v1:- To remove logical volume.
● #vgremove /dev/vg:- To remove volume group.
